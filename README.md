## Overview

This repository will house an evolving exploration of a mathematical plotting system using the digits of π to generate a spiral path across a quadrant-based grid.

The idea is to:
- Use segments or differences of π's digits
- Translate those into directional or positional changes
- Apply mathematical transformations (e.g., square roots, parity) to guide movement
- Generate a consistent, expanding spiral pattern on a 2D plane

This concept was originally conceived by Randall Simmons and is currently being reconstructed and refined through further experimentation.

## Goals

- Define the plotting rules
- Experiment with different ways to group digits (1, 4, 15, 92, 653...)
- Establish a consistent growth pattern or transformation rule
- Create visual plots or simulations
- Turn the concept into a puzzle or exploration tool

## Repository Structure (To Come)

- `/notes/` – Working notes and logic drafts
- `/visuals/` – Hand-drawn or rendered spiral plots
- `/code/` – Any scripting used to generate the spiral
- `/puzzles/` – Future interactive or printable puzzles based on the spiral

## Current Status

Work in progress. If you're viewing this early, it's just the seed of a larger idea. Randall is currently working on refining the core logic of how digits affect grid movement and spiral shape.

Stay tuned!
